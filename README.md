# CSE 4940 2023 Fall Team 32

Basic outline to get you started with your repo.

## Issues Tab

Some issues representing tasks for this class.

## Actions Tab

You can set this up to automatically run tests whenever you commit. I have not played with this much, but it's probably a good idea to add some testing to your project.

## Projects Tab

Project management board and with issues added. You can view the Project in timeline-view or boards-view.

## Wiki Tab

Basic template for a wiki. Remember, your third "paper" will be your repository wiki.

## Usage

### Client

```
cd client
npm run dev
```

### Server

```
cd server
npm run start
```

If you want to use `bun` instead of `node`, just replace `npm` with `bun`.
